Building a collaborative drawing application using WebSocket connections in C will involve several steps. Here's a general outline along with some resources to help you get started:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You'll also need a WebSocket library like libwebsockets or libwebsocket. Here are some resources:

- [libwebsockets](https://libwebsockets.org/)
- [libwebsocket](https://libwebsockets.org/)

Follow the installation instructions provided with the library you choose.

### Step 2: Plan Your Drawing Application

Decide on the features you want your drawing application to have. Consider things like:

- Drawing tools (pen, brush, eraser, etc.)
- Colors
- User authentication (optional)
- Saving and loading drawings (optional)

### Step 3: Design the WebSocket Server

Design the WebSocket server that will handle connections from clients and relay drawing commands between them. You'll need to:

- Initialize the WebSocket server.
- Handle incoming WebSocket connections.
- Manage WebSocket sessions.
- Relay drawing commands between clients.

### Step 4: Implement the WebSocket Server in C

Write the code for your WebSocket server using the WebSocket library you chose. Here are some general steps:

- Initialize the WebSocket server and set up event handling.
- Accept incoming WebSocket connections.
- Handle WebSocket messages containing drawing commands.
- Broadcast drawing commands to all connected clients.

### Step 5: Design the Client Interface

Design the interface for the drawing application. You'll need to create a canvas where users can draw and select drawing tools, colors, etc.

### Step 6: Implement the Client Interface

Write the client-side code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use a WebSocket library in JavaScript to connect to the WebSocket server and send/receive drawing commands.

### Step 7: Test and Debug

Test your collaborative drawing application to ensure it works as expected. Debug any issues you encounter.

### Step 8: Deploy Your Application

Once your application is working correctly, you can deploy it to a server so that multiple users can access it simultaneously.

### Resources:

- [libwebsockets Documentation](https://libwebsockets.org/lws-api-doc-master/html/index.html): Official documentation for libwebsockets.
- [WebSocket Protocol RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455): The official WebSocket protocol specification.
- Online tutorials and examples: Search online for tutorials and examples of building WebSocket servers and collaborative drawing applications in C. There may be open-source projects you can learn from as well.

By following these steps and using the provided resources, you should be able to build a collaborative drawing application using WebSocket connections in C. Good luck!
